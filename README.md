# CoH Farming Stats
Determine how efficient your city of heroes farming is

Requirements:
This is a quick script which requries the use of [LinqPad 5](https://www.linqpad.net/Download.aspx) which is an amazing tool. At some point I might make a standalone version but for now it uses linqpad for the output

Usage:
Enable chat logging in City of Heroes (/logchat to toggle in game or in the settings)

Download the linqpad script "CoH_XpInfParsing.linq" from the [source here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/draconb/coh-farming-stats/master/CoH_XpInfParsing.linq) and then import it into linqpad.

Update the file name near the top of the script to one of your chat logs

Press "F5" or the Green play button to run

See your results at the bottom half of the window!
