# CoH Farming Stats
Determine how efficient your City of Heroes farming is

Requirements:
This is a quick script which requries the use of [LinqPad 5](https://www.linqpad.net/Download.aspx) which is an amazing tool. At some point I might make a standalone version but for now it uses linqpad for the output

Usage:
Enable chat logging in City of Heroes (/logchat to toggle in game or in the settings)

Download the linqpad script "CoH_XpInfParsing.linq" from the [source here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/draconb/coh-farming-stats/master/CoH_XpInfParsing.linq) and then import it into linqpad.

Update the file name near the top of the script to one of your chat logs
